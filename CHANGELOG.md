  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/compare/2.36.5...2.37.0)

## 4.12.0

### Support for Xcode 16.0 (BREAKING CHANGE)

If you are using Xcode 16.0, you will need to update the SDK to version `4.12.0` or later.
If you are still using Xcode 15.4 or earlier, you need to continue to use version `4.11.0` or earlier.

Using Xcode 16 to build .NET applications targeting iOS and Mac Catalyst requires [.NET workload for iOS SDK version 18.0.8303](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-8.0.1xx-xcode16.0-8303). We [built the SDK version 4.12.0 using Xcode 16](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3635/files) in order to support this scenario. That, unfortunately, breaks folks using older version of Xcode.

As such, if you are using SDK version `4.12.x` and targeting iOS or Mac Catalyst, you will need to install and use Xcode 16 and `workload iOS SDK 18.0.8303`

Note that .NET 9 will also support Xcode 16, when it is released next month (Nov 2024).

### API Changes

- The `SentrySdk.Metrics` module is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
  Sentry will reject all metrics sent after October 7, 2024.

### Fixes

- Fixed duplicate key exception for Hangfire jobs with AutomaticRetry ([#3631](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3631))

### Features

- Added a flag to options `DisableFileWrite` to allow users to opt-out of all file writing operations. Note that toggling this will affect features such as offline caching and auto-session tracking and release health as these rely on some file persistency ([#3614](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3614), [#3641](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3641))

### Fixes
- On mobile devices, the SDK no longer throws a `FormatException` for `ProcessorFrequency` when trying to report native events ([#3541](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3541))
- Add missing org parameter to the CLI release operations ([#3600](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3600))

### API Changes

    - IMPORTANT: Verify this in test/staging before prod! Blocking calls in hot paths could create a lot of events for your Sentry project.
    - Opt-in via `options.CaptureBlockingCalls = true`
    - Disabled for specific code blocks with `using (new SuppressBlockingDetection())`
    - Doesn't detect everything. See original [Caveats described by Ben Adams](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.BlockingDetector?tab=readme-ov-file#caveats).
- Added Crons support via `SentrySdk.CaptureCheckIn` and an integration with Hangfire ([#3128](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3128))
- Common tags set automatically for metrics and metrics summaries are attached to Spans ([#3191](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3191))

  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/compare/2.28.6...2.30.0)

## 4.1.2

### Fixes

- Metric unit names are now sanitized correctly. This was preventing some built in metrics from showing in the Sentry dashboard ([#3151](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3151))
- The Sentry OpenTelemetry integration no longer throws an exception with the SDK disabled ([#3156](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3156))

## 4.1.1

### Fixes

- The SDK can be disabled by setting `options.Dsn = "";` By convention, the SDK allows the DSN set to `string.Empty` to be overwritten by the environment. ([#3147](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3147))

### Dependencies

- Bump CLI from v2.28.0 to v2.28.6 ([#3145](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3145), [#3148](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3148))

  - The class `Sentry.Constants` has been renamed to `Sentry.SentryConstants` ([#3125](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3125))

## 4.0.2

### Fixes

- To resolve conflicting types due to the SDK adding itself to the global usings:

  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/compare/8.19.0...8.20.0)

## 4.0.0

This major release includes many exciting new features including support for [Profiling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/profiling/) and [Metrics](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/metrics/)(preview), [AOT](https://sentry.engineering/blog/should-you-could-you-aot) with [Native Crash Reporting](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2770), [Spotlight](https://spotlightjs.com/), Screenshots on MAUI and much more. Details about these features and other changes are below.

### .NET target framework changes

We're dropping support for some of the old target frameworks, please check this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/discussions/2776) for details on why.

- **Replace support for .NET Framework 4.6.1 with 4.6.2** ([#2786](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2786))

  .NET Framework 4.6.1 was announced on Nov 30, 2015. And went out of support over a year ago, on Apr 26, 2022.

- **Drop .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 support** ([#2787](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2787))

- **Dropped netstandard2.0 support for Sentry.AspNetCore** ([#2807](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2807))

- **Replace support for .NET 6 on mobile (e.g: `net6.0-android`) with .NET 7** ([#2624](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2604))

  .NET 6 on mobile has been out of support since May 2023 and with .NET 8, it's no longer possible to build .NET 6 Mobile specific targets.
  For that reason, we're moving the mobile-specific TFMs from `net6.0-platform` to `net7.0-platform`.

  Mobile apps still work on .NET 6 will pull the `Sentry` .NET 6, which offers the .NET-only features,
  without native/platform-specific bindings and SDKs. See [this ticket for more details](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2623).

- **MAUI dropped Tizen support** ([#2734](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2734))

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

If you're using `sentry.io` this change does not affect you.
This SDK version is compatible with a self-hosted version of Sentry `22.12.0` or higher. If you are using an older version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka on-premise), you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).

### Significant change in behavior

- Transaction names for ASP.NET Core are now consistently named `HTTP-VERB /path` (e.g. `GET /home`). Previously, the leading forward slash was missing for some endpoints. ([#2808](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2808))
- Setting `SentryOptions.Dsn` to `null` now throws `ArgumentNullException` during initialization. ([#2655](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2655))
- Enable `CaptureFailedRequests` by default ([#2688](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2688))
- Added `Sentry` namespace to global usings when `ImplicitUsings` is enabled ([#3043](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3043))
If you have conflicts, you can opt out by adding the following to your `csproj`:
```
<PropertyGroup>
  <SentryImplicitUsings>false</SentryImplicitUsings>
</PropertyGroup>
```
- Transactions' spans are no longer automatically finished with the status `deadline_exceeded` by the transaction. This is now handled by the [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay).
  - Customers self hosting Sentry must use verion 22.12.0 or later ([#3013](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3013))
- The `User.IpAddress` is now set to `{{auto}}` by default, even when sendDefaultPII is disabled ([#2981](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2981))
  - The "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" option in the "Security & Privacy" project settings on sentry.io can be used to control this instead
- The `DiagnosticLogger` signature for `LogWarning` changed to take the `exception` as the first parameter. That way it no longer gets mixed up with the TArgs. ([#2987](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2987))

### API breaking Changes

If you have compilation errors you can find the affected types or overloads missing in the changelog entries below.

#### Changed APIs

- Class renamed `Sentry.User` to `Sentry.SentryUser` ([#3015](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3015))
- Class renamed `Sentry.Runtime` to `Sentry.SentryRuntime` ([#3016](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3016))
- Class renamed `Sentry.Span` to `Sentry.SentrySpan` ([#3021](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3021))
- Class renamed `Sentry.Transaction` to `Sentry.SentryTransaction` ([#3023](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3023))
- Rename iOS and MacCatalyst platform-specific options from `Cocoa` to `Native` ([#2940](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2940))
- Rename iOS platform-specific options `EnableCocoaSdkTracing` to `EnableTracing` ([#2940](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2940))
- Rename Android platform-specific options from `Android` to `Native` ([#2940](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2940))
- Rename Android platform-specific options `EnableAndroidSdkTracing` and `EnableAndroidSdkBeforeSend` to `EnableTracing` and `EnableBeforeSend` respectively ([#2940](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2940))
- Rename iOS and MacCatalyst platform-specific options from `iOS` to `Cocoa` ([#2929](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2929))
- `ITransaction` has been renamed to `ITransactionTracer`. You will need to update any references to these interfaces in your code to use the new interface names ([#2731](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2731), [#2870](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2870))
- `DebugImage` and `DebugMeta` moved to `Sentry.Protocol` namespace. ([#2815](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2815))
- `SentryClient.Dispose` is no longer obsolete ([#2842](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2842))
- `ISentryClient.CaptureEvent` overloads have been replaced by a single method accepting optional `Hint` and `Scope` parameters. You will need to pass `hint` as a named parameter from code that calls `CaptureEvent` without passing a `scope` argument. ([#2749](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2749))
- `TransactionContext` and `SpanContext` constructors were updated. If you're constructing instances of these classes, you will need to adjust the order in which you pass parameters to these. ([#2694](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2694), [#2696](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2696))
- The `DiagnosticLogger` signature for `LogError` and `LogFatal` changed to take the `exception` as the first parameter. That way it no longer gets mixed up with the TArgs. The `DiagnosticLogger` now also receives an overload for `LogError` and `LogFatal` that accepts a message only. ([#2715](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2715))
- `Distribution` added to `IEventLike`. ([#2660](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2660))
- `StackFrame`'s `ImageAddress`, `InstructionAddress`, and `FunctionId` changed to `long?`. ([#2691](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2691))
- `DebugImage.ImageAddress` changed to `long?`. ([#2725](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2725))
- Contexts now inherit from `IDictionary` rather than `ConcurrentDictionary`. The specific dictionary being used is an implementation detail. ([#2729](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2729))
- The method used to configure a Sentry Sink for Serilog now has an additional overload. Calling `WriteTo.Sentry()` with no arguments will no longer attempt to initialize the SDK (it has optional arguments to configure the behavior of the Sink only). If you want to initialize Sentry at the same time you configure the Sentry Sink then you will need to use the overload of this method that accepts a DSN as the first parameter (e.g. `WriteTo.Sentry("https://d4d82fc1c2c4032a83f3a29aa3a3aff@fake-sentry.io:65535/2147483647")`). ([#2928](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2928))

#### Removed APIs

- SentrySinkExtensions.ConfigureSentrySerilogOptions is now internal. If you were using this method, please use one of the `SentrySinkExtensions.Sentry` extension methods instead. ([#2902](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2902))

  - `DebugDiagnosticLogger` - use `TraceDiagnosticLogger` instead.
- A number of iOS/Android-specific `[Obsolete]` options have been removed ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
  - `Distribution` - use `SentryOptions.Distribution` instead.
  - `EnableAutoPerformanceTracking` - use `SetBeforeSendTransaction` instead.
  - `EnableCoreDataTracking` - use `EnableCoreDataTracing` instead.
  - `EnableFileIOTracking` - use `EnableFileIOTracing` instead.
  - `EnableOutOfMemoryTracking` - use `EnableWatchdogTerminationTracking` instead.
  - `EnableUIViewControllerTracking` - use `EnableUIViewControllerTracing` instead.
  - `StitchAsyncCode` - no longer available.
  - `ProfilingTracesInterval` - no longer available.
  - `ProfilingEnabled` - use `ProfilesSampleRate` instead.
- Obsolete `SystemClock` constructor removed, use `SystemClock.Clock` instead. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `Runtime.Clone()` removed, this shouldn't have been public in the past and has no replacement. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `SentryException.Data` removed, use `SentryException.Mechanism.Data` instead. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `AssemblyExtensions` removed, this shouldn't have been public in the past and has no replacement. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `SentryDatabaseLogging.UseBreadcrumbs()` removed, it is called automatically and has no replacement. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `Scope.GetSpan()` removed, use `Span` property instead. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856))
- Obsolete `IUserFactory` removed, use `ISentryUserFactory` instead. ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2856), [#2840](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2840))
- `IHasMeasurements` has been removed, use `ISpanData` instead. ([#2659](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2659))
- `IHasBreadcrumbs` has been removed, use `IEventLike` instead. ([#2670](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2670))
- `ISpanContext` has been removed, use `ITraceContext` instead. ([#2668](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2668))
- `IHasTransactionNameSource` has been removed, use `ITransactionContext` instead. ([#2654](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2654))
- ([#2694](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2694))
- The unused `StackFrame.InstructionOffset` has been removed. ([#2691](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2691))
- The unused `Scope.Platform` property has been removed. ([#2695](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2695))
- The obsolete setter `Sentry.PlatformAbstractions.Runtime.Identifier` has been removed ([2764](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2764))
- `Sentry.Values<T>` is now internal as it is never exposed in the public API ([#2771](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2771))
- The `TracePropagationTarget` class has been removed, use the `SubstringOrRegexPattern` class instead. ([#2763](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2763))
- The `WithScope` and `WithScopeAsync` methods have been removed. We have discovered that these methods didn't work correctly in certain desktop contexts, especially when using a global scope. ([#2717](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2717))

  Replace your usage of `WithScope` with overloads of `Capture*` methods:

  - `SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(SentryEvent @event, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`
  - `SentrySdk.CaptureMessage(string message, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`
  - `SentrySdk.CaptureException(Exception exception, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`

  ```c#
  // Before
  SentrySdk.WithScope(scope =>
  {
    scope.SetTag("key", "value");
    SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(new SentryEvent());
  });

  // After
  SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(new SentryEvent(), scope =>
  {
    // Configure your scope here
    scope.SetTag("key", "value");
  });
  ```

### Features

- Experimental pre-release availability of Metrics. We're exploring the use of Metrics in Sentry. The API will very likely change and we don't yet have any documentation. ([#2949](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2949))
  - `SentrySdk.Metrics.Set` now additionally accepts `string` as value ([#3092](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3092))
  - Timing metrics can now be captured with `SentrySdk.Metrics.StartTimer` ([#3075](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3075))
  - Added support for capturing built-in metrics from the `System.Diagnostics.Metrics` API ([#3052](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3052))
- `Sentry.Profiling` is now available as a package on [nuget](nuget.org). Be aware that profiling is in alpha and on servers the overhead could be high. Improving the experience for ASP.NET Core is tracked on [this issue](
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2316) ([#2800](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2800))
  - iOS profiling support (alpha). ([#2930](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2930))
- Native crash reporting on NativeAOT published apps (Windows, Linux, macOS). ([#2887](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2887))
- Support for [Spotlight](https://spotlightjs.com/), a debug tool for local development. ([#2961](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2961))
  - Enable it with the option `EnableSpotlight`
  - Optionally configure the URL to connect via `SpotlightUrl`. Defaults to `http://localhost:8969/stream`.

### MAUI

- Added screenshot capture support for errors. You can opt-in via `SentryMauiOptions.AttachScreenshots` ([#2965](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2965))
  - Supports Android and iOS only. Windows is not supported.
- App context now has `in_foreground`, indicating whether the app was in the foreground or the background. ([#2983](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2983))
- Android: When capturing unhandled exceptions, the SDK now can automatically attach `LogCat` to the event. You can opt-in via `SentryOptions.Android.LogCatIntegration` and configure `SentryOptions.Android.LogCatMaxLines`. ([#2926](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2926))
  - Available when targeting `net7.0-android` or later, on API level 23 or later.

#### Native AOT

Native AOT publishing support for .NET 8 has been added to Sentry for the following platforms:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS
- Mac Catalyst
- iOS

There are some functional differences when publishing Native AOT:

- `StackTraceMode.Enhanced` is ignored because it's not available when publishing Native AOT. The mechanism to generate these enhanced stack traces relies heavily on reflection which isn't compatible with trimming.
- Reflection cannot be leveraged for JSON Serialization and you may need to use `SentryOptions.AddJsonSerializerContext` to supply a serialization context for types that you'd like to send to Sentry (e.g. in the `Span.Context`). ([#2732](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2732), [#2793](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2793))
- `Ben.Demystifier` is not available as it only runs in JIT mode.
- WinUI applications: When publishing Native AOT, Sentry isn't able to automatically register an unhandled exception handler because that relies on reflection. You'll need to [register the unhandled event handler manually](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2778) instead.
- For Azure Functions Workers, when AOT/Trimming is enabled we can't use reflection to read route data from the HttpTrigger so the route name will always be `/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>` ([#2920](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2920))

### Fixes

- Native integration logging on macOS ([#3079](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3079))
- The scope transaction is now correctly set for Otel transactions ([#3072](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3072))
- Fixed an issue with tag values in metrics not being properly serialized ([#3065](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3065))
- Moved the binding to MAUI events for breadcrumb creation from `WillFinishLaunching` to `FinishedLaunching`. This delays the initial instantiation of `app`. ([#3057](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3057))
- The SDK no longer adds the `WinUIUnhandledExceptionIntegration` on non-Windows platforms ([#3055](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3055))
- Stop Sentry for MacCatalyst from creating `default.profraw` in the app bundle using xcodebuild archive to build sentry-cocoa ([#2960](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2960))
- Workaround a .NET 8 NativeAOT crash on transaction finish. ([#2943](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2943))
- Reworked automatic breadcrumb creation for MAUI. ([#2900](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2900))
  - The SDK no longer uses reflection to bind to all public element events. This also fixes issues where the SDK would consume third-party events.
  - Added `CreateElementEventsBreadcrumbs` to the SentryMauiOptions to allow users to opt-in automatic breadcrumb creation for `BindingContextChanged`, `ChildAdded`, `ChildRemoved`, and `ParentChanged` on `Element`.
  - Reduced amount of automatic breadcrumbs by limiting the number of bindings created in `VisualElement`, `Window`, `Shell`, `Page`, and `Button`.
- Fixed Sentry SDK has not been initialized when using ASP.NET Core, Serilog, and OpenTelemetry ([#2911](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2911))
- Android native symbol upload ([#2876](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2876))
- `Sentry.Serilog` no longer throws if a disabled DSN is provided when initializing Sentry via the Serilog integration ([#2883](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2883))
- Don't add WinUI exception integration on mobile platforms ([#2821](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2821))
- `Transactions` are now getting enriched by the client instead of the hub ([#2838](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2838))
- Fixed an issue when using the SDK together with OpenTelemetry `1.5.0` and newer where the SDK would create transactions for itself. The fix is backward compatible. ([#3001](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/3001))

### Dependencies

- Upgraded to NLog version 5. ([#2697](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2697))
- Integrate `sentry-native` as a static library in Native AOT builds to enable symbolication. ([#2704](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2704))

## 3.33.1

### Fixes

- SentryHttpMessageHandler added when AddHttpClient is before UseSentry ([#2390](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2390))
- Set the native sdk name for Android ([#2389](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2389))
- Fix db connection spans not finishing ([#2398](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2398))
- Various .NET MAUI fixes / improvements ([#2403](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2403))
  - The battery level was being reported incorrectly due to percentage multiplier.
  - The device architecture (x64, arm64, etc.) is now reported
  - On Windows, the OS type is now reported as "Windows" instead of "WinUI".  Additionally, the OS display version (ex, "22H2") is now included.
  - `UIKit`, `ABI.Microsoft` and `WinRT`  frames are now marked "system" instead of "in app".
- Reduce debug files uploaded ([#2404](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2404))
- Fix system frames being marked as "in-app" ([#2408](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2408))
  - NOTE: This important fix corrects a value that is used during issue grouping, so you may receive new alerts for existing issues after deploying this update.
- DB Connection spans presented poorly ([#2409](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2409))
- Populate scope's Cookies property ([#2411](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2411))

### Dependencies

  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/compare/6.19.1...6.22.0)

## 3.33.0

### Features

- .NET SDK changes for exception groups ([#2287](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2287))
  - This changes how `AggregateException` is handled.  Instead of filtering them out client-side, the SDK marks them as an "exception group",
    and adds includes data that represents the hierarchical structure of inner exceptions. Sentry now recognizes this server-side,
    improving the accuracy of the issue detail page.
  - Accordingly, the `KeepAggregateException` option is now obsolete and does nothing.  Please remove any usages of `KeepAggregateException`.
  - NOTE: If running Self-Hosted Sentry, you should wait to adopt this SDK update until after updating to the 23.6.0 (est. June 2023) release of Sentry.
    The effect of updating the SDK early will be as if `KeepAggregateException = true` was set.  That will not break anything, but may affect issue grouping and alerts.

### Fixes

- Status messages when uploading symbols or sources are improved. ([#2307](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2307))

### Dependencies

- Bump CLI from v2.18.0 to v2.18.1 ([#2386](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2386))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2181)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/compare/2.18.0...2.18.1)

## 3.32.0

### Features

- Azure Functions (Isolated Worker/Out-of-Process) support ([#2346](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2346))
  - Initial `beta.1` release.  Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!
  - Documentation is TBD.  For now, see `/samples/Sentry.Samples.Azure.Functions.Worker`.

- Add `Hint` support  ([#2351](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2351))
  - Currently, this allows you to manipulate attachments in the various "before" event delegates.
  - Hints can also be used in event and transaction processors by implementing `ISentryEventProcessorWithHint` or `ISentryTransactionProcessorWithHint`, instead of `ISentryEventProcessor` or `ISentryTransactionProcessor`.
  - Note: Obsoletes the `BeforeSend`, `BeforeSendTransaction`, and `BeforeBreadcrumb` properties on the `SentryOptions` class.  They have been replaced with `SetBeforeSend`, `SetBeforeSendTransaction`, and `SetBeforeBreadcrumb` respectively.  Each one provides overloads both with and without a `Hint` object.

- Allow setting the active span on the scope ([#2364](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2364))
  - Note: Obsoletes the `Scope.GetSpan` method in favor of a `Scope.Span` property (which now has a setter as well).

- Remove authority from URLs sent to Sentry ([#2365](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2365))
- Add tag filters to `SentryOptions` ([#2367](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2367))

### Fixes

- Fix `EnableTracing` option conflict with `TracesSampleRate` ([#2368](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2368))
  - NOTE: This is a potentially breaking change, as the `TracesSampleRate` property has been made nullable.
    Though extremely uncommon, if you are _retrieving_ the `TracesSampleRate` property for some reason, you will need to account for nulls.
    However, there is no change to the behavior or _typical_ usage of either of these properties.

- CachedTransport gracefully handles malformed envelopes during processing  ([#2371](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2371))
- Remove extraneous iOS simulator resources when building MAUI apps using Visual Studio "Hot Restart" mode, to avoid hitting Windows max path  ([#2384](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/pull/2384))

## 3.29.0

**Notice:** The `<SentryUploadSymbols>` MSBuild property previously defaulted to `true` for projects compiled in `Release` configuration.
