## Sentry sample for ASP.NET MVC 5

This repository contains a sample of using Sentry with ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6.

Please note that the ASP.NET MVC 5 integration is not full yet, as it still lacks request related metadata. This will be added in a future commit.

All necessary code for the integration is inside `Global.asax.cs`
