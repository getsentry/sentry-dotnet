# Overview

This sample demonstrates how a console application that is instrumented with the OpenTelemetry .NET SDK can be
configured to send trace information to Sentry, with the following initialization code:

```csharp
using var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddSource(serviceName)
    .ConfigureResource(resource =>
        resource.AddService(
            serviceName: serviceName,
            serviceVersion: serviceVersion))
    .AddSentry() // <-- Configure OpenTelemetry to send traces to Sentry
    .Build();

SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    options.Dsn = "...Your DSN...";
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    o.UseOpenTelemetry(); // <-- Configure Sentry to use OpenTelemetry trace information
});
```

## Customizing propagation

Sentry's OpenTelemetry integration sets the DefaultTextMapPropagator for OpenTelemetry to a `SentryPropagator`. This
propagator ensures that both the W3C baggage header and the sentry-trace header get propagated from upstream services
and/or to downstream services.

If you need to further customize header propagation in your application (e.g. propagating other vendor specific headers)
then you can do so by creating a `CompositeTextMapPropagator` consisting of the custom propagator(s) you need plus the
`SentryPropagator`. You can supply this as an optional parameter to the `AddSentry` method.
