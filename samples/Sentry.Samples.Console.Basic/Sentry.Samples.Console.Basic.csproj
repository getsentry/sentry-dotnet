    After the above properties are configured, you can use the following features.
    Uploading sources to Sentry during the build will enable Source Context in the Sentry issue details page.
    Uploading symbols to Sentry will enable server-side symbolication.  However, that is not necessary here
    because the PDB file is present at runtime. Thus, .NET will symbolicate stack traces client-side.
