/*
 * This sample demonstrates the following basic features of Sentry, via a .NET console application:
 * - Error Monitoring (both handled and unhandled exceptions)
 * - Performance Tracing (Transactions / Spans)
 * - Release Health (Sessions)
 * - MSBuild integration for Source Context (see the csproj)
 *
 * For more advanced features of the SDK, see Sentry.Samples.Console.Customized.
