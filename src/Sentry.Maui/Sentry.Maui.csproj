      Because MAUI is not yet released, we must publish Sentry.Maui using a pre-release tag to avoid the following error when packing:

          error NU5104: A stable release of a package should not have a prerelease dependency.
                        Either modify the version spec of dependency "Microsoft.Maui.Dependencies [6.0.300-rc.3.5667, )"
                        or update the version field in the nuspec.

      We can use our own versioning scheme to indicate status of our library. "preview.1", "preview.2", etc.
