     * These methods map between a SentryEvent and it's Java counterpart by serializing as JSON into memory on one side,
     * then deserializing back to an object on the other side.  It is not expected to be performant, as this code is only
     * used when a BeforeSend option is set, and then only when an event is captured by the Java SDK (which should be
     * relatively rare).
     *
     * This approach avoids having to write to/from methods for the entire object graph.  However, it's also important to
     * recognize that there's not necessarily a one-to-one mapping available on all objects (even through serialization)
     * between the two SDKs, so some optional details may be lost when roundtripping.  That's generally OK, as this is
     * still better than nothing.  If a specific part of the object graph becomes important to roundtrip, we can consider
     * updating the objects on either side.
