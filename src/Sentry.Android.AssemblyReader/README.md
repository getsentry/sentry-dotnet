This package provides a mechanism to read .NET assemblies from within Android `.apk` files that were built
with [Xamarin.Android](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android), for Xamarin, MAUI, or .NET Android.

It is a supporting package for the Sentry .NET SDKs.  If using [Sentry](https://sentry.io), do not reference this package directly.
Instead, reference one of the following:

- [`Sentry.Maui`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui) - if you are using .NET MAUI
- [`Sentry.Xamarin`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin) - if you are using Xamarin
- [`Sentry`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry) - if you are authoring a .NET Android application without using MAUI or Xamarin
