If you use the current version of our .NET SDK, distributed tracing works automatically in Azure Functions Worker applications without additional configuration.

The Sentry integration automatically extracts `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers from incoming HTTP trigger requests to continue traces started by upstream services.

### Outgoing HTTP Requests

For outgoing HTTP requests, use `SentryHttpMessageHandler` when creating your `HttpClient` to automatically propagate trace headers:

```csharp
var httpClient = new HttpClient(new SentryHttpMessageHandler());
```

If you register `HttpClient` through dependency injection using `IHttpClientFactory`, the `SentryHttpMessageHandler` is automatically added — no additional setup is needed.
